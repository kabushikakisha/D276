            WORK EXPERIENCE WEB & MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPER – CULTIVATE – CHICAGO IL
            June 2018 to Present
            Developed and deployed full stack web and mobile applications
            • Power Safety App – React Native
            Power company asked us to convert safety resources to a mobile
            application including two rulebooks that we converted to HTML, a video,
            several static pages and a decision matrix for Personal Protective
            Equipment based on the work and conditions. We are updating this
            application to receive document updates from a WordPress CMS.

            o Rulebook Documents consumed and stored from WordPress API
            o Configured TestFlight internally and for client through AppStore
            Connect
            • Power Job Training Evaluation App – React, Rails, SQLServer, React
            Native
            Power company asked us to create a custom application to record
            trainee progress through their on the job training program. We built a
            React web application, a React Native mobile application and a Ruby on
            Rails API to communicate between the two. Our application records
            instances and evaluation of various tasks and coordinate practical

            • Construction Job Site App – React, Rails, MySQL, React Native
            Road construction company asked us to create a custom application to
            replace a variety of dispatch and reporting tasks that depended on
            paper forms. We built a React web application, a React Native mobile
            application and a Ruby on Rails API to communicate between the two.
            Our application dispatches trucks (both internal and broker) to retrieve
            material from external plants and deliver to ever-changing jobsites as
            well as crew and equipment. Drivers and crew members use their mobile
            applications to report the pickup and delivery of loads, job site injuries,
            daily per diems, time spent working at the job site, materials spread at
            the jobsite, and equipment operated.
            o Managed legacy code
            o On call for bugfixes and data emergencies
            o Developed time reporting for crew via mobile app and approval for
            dispatchers
            o Deployed mobile application through AppStore Connect and Play
            Store
            • Concrete App – React, Rails, MySQL, React Native
            Concrete company desired to reduce customer phone calls to their
            dispatch office for simple status updates while keeping customers
            informed. We built a customer-facing React web application that
            displayed the most frequently requested information, another React web
            application for dispatchers and a mobile application for customers.
            o Converted order request form from web to mobile
            o Added chat to customer and dispatch web apps and customer
            mobile app
